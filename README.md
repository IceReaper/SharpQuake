# SharpQuake

### Description 

SharpQuake is **[GLQuake](https://github.com/dpteam/GLQuake3D)** rewritten in C# using the **[OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk/opentk)** library.

### Dependencies
* OpenTK 3.0.1
* **[OpenAL](https://www.openal.org/downloads/)** (Windows) / libopenal on Linux
* **[SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)** (Windows and macOS) / libsdl2-2.0 on Linux (Runtime binaries)
  
### Building

**Project is built against and tested for Visual Studio 2019 on .NET 4.7.2**

1) **Add the OpenTK nuget package with the package manager console in visual studio.**
    - `Install-Package OpenTK -Version 3.0.1`

2) **Initialize git submodules**

3) **Add dependencies for your target architecture in your output directory (defaults to `<project root>/Quake`).**
    - See links under dependencies header above
4) **Add ld1, hipnotic, and rogue (minimum ld1) data directories to `<project root>/Quake`.**
    - You only need the `<mod>\pak0.pak`, etc. and `<mod>\config.cfg` files of each directory if copying from a steam install.

5) **Build solution.**

### Running

In case you don't own a copy of Quake you can purchase it on **[GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/quake_the_offering)**, **[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310/QUAKE/)** or use the **[shareware version](https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/411-quake-shareware-pak/)**.

**As Linux is case-sensitive make sure your folder and file names look like that `Id1` and `PAK0.PAK` and `PAK1.PAK` (in case you own the full version).**

**macOS / OSX is not official supported as OpenGL on Mac is poorly supported and has been replaced in favour of their own graphics API [Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(API)).**

The `-basedir <directory>` switch can be used to change the default data directory. e.g. `SharpQuake.exe -basedir C:\Quake\`

`-window` switch is pre-defined in project settings, but if you change the default directory of where you want your data, you may need to add `-basedir <directory>` to `project properties > Debug > Command line arguments` 

The original expansion packs can be run using `-rogue` or `-hipnotic` switches if the data is present for it.

Original Quake switches apply and can be used.

Enjoy! ðŸ™‚
